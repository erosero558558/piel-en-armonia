# Instructions for AI Agents and Developers

## Code Organization
* **Source Code**: The source code for the frontend is located in the `js/` and `src/` directories.
  * `js/main.js`: The entry point for the main script.
  * `js/*.js`: Shared utility and logic modules (e.g., `loader.js`, `state.js`, `utils.js`).
  * `src/apps/`: Application-specific logic (e.g., booking, admin, chat).
* **Build Artifacts**: Do NOT edit the following files directly, as they are generated by the build process:
  * `script.js` (generated from `js/main.js`)
  * `booking-engine.js` (generated from `src/apps/booking/engine.js`)
  * `booking-ui.js` (generated from `src/apps/booking/ui-entry.js`)
  * `chat-*.js` (generated from `src/apps/chat/*.js`)
  * `js/booking-calendar.js` (generated from `src/apps/booking/components/calendar.js`)

## Build Process
* To rebuild the project after making changes to the source code:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
* This command uses Rollup (configured in `rollup.config.mjs`) to bundle the modules into the final scripts used by the browser.

## Testing
* Run `npm test` to execute the Playwright test suite.
* Run `npm run test:php` for PHP tests.

## Maintenance
* If you need to modify the logic in `script.js`, edit the corresponding files in `js/` or `src/` and then run `npm run build`.
* The "monolithic" nature of `script.js` is an intentional build optimization (bundling), but the source code is modular and maintainable.
