# Analysis Report

## Overview
This report details the findings from a codebase analysis performed on `2026-02-20`.

## Findings

### 1. PHP Code Style Violations
The automated style checker (`composer run lint`) identified **120 files** that do not adhere to the project's coding standards (PSR-12). These issues include formatting, indentation, and missing strict type declarations.

**Recommendation:**
Run the following command to automatically fix these issues:
```bash
composer run fix
```

### 2. JavaScript Linting Configuration Error
The JavaScript linting command (`npm run lint:js`) failed with the following error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'globals'
```
This indicates that the `globals` dependency, although listed in `package.json`, is not correctly installed or resolved in the development environment. This prevents the linter from running and checking for JavaScript errors.

**Recommendation:**
Verify the `node_modules` installation or re-install dependencies using `npm ci` or `npm install`.

### 3. Test Coverage & Status
All **37 PHP tests** passed successfully (`npm run test:php`). No functional regressions were detected in the backend logic.

### 4. Syntax Checks
No syntax errors were found in the PHP codebase (`npm run lint:php` passed).
