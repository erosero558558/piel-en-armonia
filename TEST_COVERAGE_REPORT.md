# Test Coverage Analysis
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Mixed (PHP Pass, JS Regressions)

## 1. Executive Summary
The test coverage analysis reveals a robust test suite for the backend (PHP) with a 100% pass rate across both PHPUnit and custom integration scripts. The frontend (JS) relies heavily on End-to-End (E2E) testing via Playwright, which is currently passing at 94% but exhibiting 5 specific failures related to funnel tracking and resource preloading. Quantitative code coverage metrics could not be generated due to missing drivers in the current environment.

## 2. Test Execution Results

### 🟢 PHP Backend (100% Pass)
*   **PHPUnit Suite**: 49/49 tests passed.
    *   Covers: `lib/` directory (Units, Booking, Payment, Security).
*   **Custom Integration Runner**: 39/39 test suites passed.
    *   Covers: Critical flows, backup/restore, rate limiting, and legacy logic.
    *   Key tests passed: `CriticalFlowsE2ETest`, `verify_backups_p0`, `test_business_iva`.

### 🟡 Frontend / E2E (94% Pass)
*   **Playwright**: 85/90 tests passed.
*   **Failures**: 5 tests failed.
    1.  `tests/funnel-tracking.spec.js` (2 failures): `ReferenceError: serviceSelect is not defined`. Likely a script error in the test code itself.
    2.  `tests/funnel-tracking.spec.js` (1 failure): Timeout waiting for `page.goto('/')`.
    3.  `tests/hero-preload-paths.spec.js` (2 failures): `hero preload/image returned an error status` on `/servicios/acne.html` and `/servicios/laser.html`.

## 3. Code Coverage Gaps

### PHP
*   **Metric**: Unavailable (Missing Xdebug/PCOV drivers).
*   **Qualitative Assessment**: High coverage for business logic (`lib/`) and critical integration paths. Lower coverage likely for root-level legacy controllers (`api.php` direct handling) not routed through `lib/`.

### JavaScript
*   **Metric**: Unknown (No instrumentation).
*   **Gap**: Reliance on E2E tests means internal logic of complex engines (e.g., `booking-engine.js`, `chat-engine.js`) is only tested indirectly. There are no dedicated unit tests (e.g., Jest/Vitest) for these modules.

## 4. Recommendations
1.  **Fix Playwright Regressions**: Address the `serviceSelect` reference error in `funnel-tracking.spec.js` and investigate the 404/error status for hero images on service pages.
2.  **Enable Coverage Drivers**: Install `pcov` or `xdebug` in the CI/Development environment to generate actionable coverage reports (`coverage.xml`).
3.  **Introduce JS Unit Tests**: Consider adding a lightweight unit test runner for the "Engine" JS files to test logic in isolation from the DOM.
